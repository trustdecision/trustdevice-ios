# TrustDevice-iOS
A lightweight library for determining device uniqueness and risk identification.

Create a device identifier based on basic device information.

Will remain the same after uninstalling and reinstalling or clearing app data.

🪧Attention🪧：The functions of the basic version of github are relatively limited. 

You can visit [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-5fkjqqnkoajcs?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa) or [TrustDecision](https://trustdecision.com/solutions/device-fingerprint)  to learn about our professional version.

## Installation
### Swift Package Manager

1. In Xcode, select **File → Swift Packages → Add Package Dependency...**
2. Enter the repository URL, for example:

   ```text
   https://github.com/zeinber/TDOCSDK.git
   ```
3. Specify a version range (e.g. `from: "1.0.0"`).

### Cocoapods
1. TrustDecision is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
# Podfile
pod 'TrustDecision', '1.6.0.1'
```

## Quick Start 

### 1. Get DeviceInfo
DeviceInfo contains device id, risk information and device details.

#### Objective-C

```objective-c
#import <TrustDecision/TDMobRisk.h>

TDMobRiskManager_t *manager = [TDMobRiskManager sharedManager];
NSMutableDictionary *options = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
[options setObject:^(NSDictionary *response) {
    // Response in sub-thread, do something with the response
    // Get DeviceId
    NSString *deviceId = response[@"device_id"];
    // Get DeviceRiskLabel
    NSDictionary *deviceRisk = response[@"device_risk_label"];
    // Get DeviceDetail
    NSDictionary *deviceDetail = response[@"device_detail"];
} forKey:@"callback"];
manager->initWithOptions(options);
```

#### Swift

```swift
import TrustDecision

var options = [String : NSObject]()
let responseCallback: ([String : Any])-> Void = { response in
    // Response in sub-thread, do something with the response
    // Get DeviceId
    let deviceId = response["device_id"]   
    // Get DeviceRiskLabel
    let deviceRisk = response["device_risk_label"]
    // Get DeviceDetail
    let deviceDetail = response["device_detail"]                                         
}
options["callback"] = unsafeBitCast(responseCallback as @convention(block) ([String : Any]) -> Void, to: AnyObject.self) as? NSObject
let manager = TDMobRiskManager.sharedManager()
manager?.pointee.initWithOptions(options)
```

## Open Source Features

+ Basic device ID, consistent when uninstalling applications and reinstalling
+ Basic equipment information, which can be used for simple data analysis
+ Basic risk identification ability

| RiskLabel | Risk Description                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| jailbreak | Attackers will have higher privileges and can install many cheating software to affect the normal development of application business. |
| simulator | The simulator provides many simulation functions, which will affect the normal operation of applications, such as virtual positioning. |
| debug     | Applications can be modified by attackers at will, and the program will return unexpected values. |
